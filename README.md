# Active Inference Control for an Interbotix PincherX 150 Robotic Manipulator 🦾

This repository contains code developed for my MSc thesis project focused on enhancing the Active Inference Controller (AIC) developed in [1] for robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, a modified version of the AIC, called the Reactive Active Inference Controller (ReAIC), was implemented and evaluated on an [Interbotix PincherX 150](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/specifications/px150.html) 5-DOF manipulator using ROS (Robot Operating System). Additionally, several other controllers, including the original AIC [1], the classic PID controller and an Adaptive Friction Compensator (AFC) [2] were implemented for comparison.

## Setup
All experiments were executed using [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/) OS and [ROS Noetic](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic).

Create a ROS workspace by navigating to the desired directory where you will store all your code, then execute the following:

```bash
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
```

```bash
mkdir ./interbotix_pincherX_ws/src
cd ./interbotix_pincherX_ws/
catkin_make
```

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```

### Setting-up [Interbotix X-Series Arm Packages](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_manipulators/tree/main/interbotix_ros_xsarms):
Please consult the Trossen Robotics [installation guide](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/ros_interface.html) for your specific setup. Make sure to save all packages within the `src/` directory of your workspace.

Additionally you will need the following package that contains support level ROS wrappers and robot interface modules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_toolboxes.git
```
> [!NOTE]
> The default setups should be changed to suit your control method. In this case we used PWM to control the [Dynamixel Servo Motors](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl430-w250/).
> Navigate to `interbotix_xsarm_control/config/modes.yaml` and change `operating_mode: pwm`.

> Navigate to `interbotix_xsarm_control/config/px150.yaml` and change `update_rate: 1000` in order to allow the joint states publishe to update at a rate of 1 kHz.

### Clone this repository:
In the `src/` directory of yout workspace clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlonDawe/interbotix_aic_control.git
```

### Compile your workspace

Navigate to your workspace directory and run the following:

```bash
catkin_make
```

## Controlling the Robot 

In order to get the PincherX 150 up and running, run the following:

```bash
roslaunch interbotix_xsarm_control xsarm_control.launch robot_model:=px150
```

You should now be able to see the libe robot rendered in rviz.

then run the following:

> [!CAUTION]
> The following launch file will make the one specific joint move in step maneuvers. Please ensure that the robot has been placed in a position such that it will will not hit anything, and that you have made sure which joint will be controlled. This should be checked in both `interbotix_aic_control/src/*selected controller*_controller.cpp` and `interbotix_aic_control/src/*selected controller*.cpp`

```bash
roslaunch interbotix_aic_control ReAIC_control.launch
```
